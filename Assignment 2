2.1.5 Section Review, Questions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
1. The CPU contains registers as well as a high-frequency clock. a control unit, and an arithmetic logic unit.
2. The CPU is connected to the rest of the computer system by the  data bus, the I/O bus and the address bus.
3. Because reading a single value from memory requires 4 steps and each step takes a clock cycle to execute, while CPU registers can be accessed in 1 clock cycle.
4. Fetch, Decode, Execute
5. The CPU fetches the operands from registers and memory and if an output operand is used, the CPU stores the result of its execution in the operand.
2.4.2 Section Review, Question 5
5. What is the purpose of the 8259A PIC controller? The 8259A PIC controller handles external interrupts from hardware devices (i.e keyboards, system clock, disk drives).

2.5.2 Section Review, Questions 1, 3, 4, 5
1. Of the four levels of input/output in a computer system, which is the most universal and portable?
Application program - level 3

3. Why are device drivers necessary,
Because they allow the OS to communicate directly with hardware ddrvices and the system BIOS.

4. In the example regarding displaying a string of characters, which level exists between the operating system and the video controller card?
BIOS function.

5. Is it likely that the BIOS for a computer running MS-Windows would be different from that used by a computer running Linux?
No.

2.7 Review Questions 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 19, 20, 25, 26
7. Which part of the CPU performs floating-point arithmetic?
The floating point unit.

8. On a 32-bit processor, how many bits are contained in each floating-point data register?
80-bits

9. (True/False): The x86-64 instruction set is backward-compatible with the x86 instruction set.
True

10. (True/False): In current 64-bit chip implementations, all 64 bits are used for addressing.
False

12. (True/False): Static RAM is usually less expensive than dynamic RAM.
False

20. (True/False): CMOS RAM is the same as static RAM, meaning that it holds its value without
any extra power or refresh cycles.
False

25. At which level(s) can an assembly language program manipulate input/output?
BIOS, OS, Hardware

26. Why do game programs often send their sound output directly to the sound cardâ€™s hardware ports?
It gives them better control of hardware and makes execution faster.
