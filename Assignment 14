-Which assignment took you the longest to complete?
The assignment that took me the longest to complete was the boolean  calculator because it took  me a while to realize that a lot of the necessary functions required to complete could be found in the book.

-Which assignment was the most difficult?
The most difficult assignment was the last assignment which had us create a bubble sort to sort an array's contents in numerical order. This was because I had not attended the lecture or followed along in class, so I had to write the whole code pretty much from scratch.

-Which assignment was the easiest?
The easiest assignment was the random screen locations coding assignment.

-Of the concepts we covered, which (if any) are you the most confused about still?
I'm still unsure of the push and pop functions and how they work in masm.

-If we had an extra week to spend on any of the concepts covered in this course, which one would it be?
I would have liked going over different sorting algorithms and how to implement them in assembly.

-Were there any assignments you felt were unnecessarily tedious (not necessarily difficult,  but that took too long to complete)?
No assignment felt tedious to me as each one offered a great learning experience and honestly made me a stronger programmer.

-Which assignment was your favorite?
My favorite assignment was the bubble-sort assignment because of its difficulty. It wasn't too difficult but still required me to pay close attention to how I was manipulating my registers.

-Which assignment do you think you learned the most from?
It's hard to choose which assignment I learned the most from since they all taught me something new. Generally the coding assignments were the most informative as it allowed me to play around with masm and see how things worked first-hand rather than just reading about it and seeing examples.

-Were the assignment requirements and due dates clear enough? If not, how so?
The requirements were very clear in my experience.

-On a scale of 1-5, rate the difficulty (1=Breating, 5=Exiting Vim) of this course compared  to other CIS courses you've taken.

-Was the book used in this course effective/helpful? Would you recommend a different one?
It was helpful and downright necessary for a couple of the assignments. Overall, I used the book regularly whenever I was stuck on an assignment.

-Were there any topics that we didn't cover that you would have liked to see included?
None that I have in mind.

-How can this course be improved?
The course can be improved by encouraging students to work together on assignments during lab time. To learn from one another and to teach each other. Perhaps having more challenging assignments evvery now and then where student must work together to figure them out.
